## Project Description

SwingSync is meant to help provide instant feedback on your golf swing. SwingSync uses TensorFlow pose estimation models to draw a real-time skeleton of keypoints of your body from a video. This is meant to highlight and identify patterns in your swing that may be causing an undesirable flight path (ie. head dipping too low, arms too far behind hips).
